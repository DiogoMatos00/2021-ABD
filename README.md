In this project, I created a database and developed an application to manage and organize scouting materials. I designed both the conceptual and physical models to aid in the database construction. It was used Oracle's SQL Data Modeler for building the relational model from the conceptual design, and Oracle SQL Developer for simplifying database management and development.
